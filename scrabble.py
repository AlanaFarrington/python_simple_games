# board is 15 x 15 grid
# each player gets given 7 random letter tiles from the 100 tiles
# word must be minimum of 2 letters long
# must run check that word guessed only uses letters that they have in their letter list
# check word against dictionary (dictionary module?)
# used letters must be removed from players letter list and then replaced with new tiles from remaining tiles list after each turn
# 50 point bonus for playing a word with all 7 of their letter tiles
# game ends when all the tiles have been drawn and one of the players has used all the tiles in their rack or both players have passed consecutively
# final scores are reduced by the amount of points on the players unplayer tiles
# player with most points wins the game

# EXTRA CHALLENGES
# make your letter_to_points dictionary able to handle lowercase inputs as well
# check if inputted words are real using a dictionary scraper
# plan out a board as a simple UI 

# make dictionary of letter points
